Drop
===========================

This is my implementation of the libGDX simple tutorial - <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game">A simple game</a> and <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Extending-the-simple-game">Extending the simiple game</a>.

In case it changes, they, and I, took the assets from:

- water drop sound by junggle, see http://www.freesound.org/people/junggle/sounds/30341/
- rain by acclivity, see http://www.freesound.org/people/acclivity/sounds/28283/
- droplet sprite by mvdv, see https://www.box.com/s/peqrdkwjl6guhpm48nit
- bucket sprite by mvdv, see https://www.box.com/s/605bvdlwuqubtutbyf4x
